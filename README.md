SORT  Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part.Values from the unsorted part are picked and placedat the correct position in the sorted part. [22,27,16,2,18,6].            (1)                                                                 1)    [22||27,16,2,18,6]                                                        2)    [22,27||16,2,18,6]                            3)    [16,22,27||2,18,6]                              4)    [2,16,22,27||18,6]                            5)    [2,16,18,22,27|6]                                      6)    [2,6,16,18,22,27||]                            (2)  1)   O(n2)                                            (3) 1) BEST CASE    : if given sequentially - n                                        2) AVERAGE CASE : average of best and worst cases - n²                               3) WORST CASE   : if given in reverse order - n*((n+1)/2) -> n²                 (4)Since it is in the middle of the dataset, it is covered by the average case.                                                       (5)Write down the first 4 steps of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15.6] according to Insertion Sort.                                           1)    [3,5,8,2,9,4,15.6]                                       2)   [3,7|5,8,2,9,4,15.6]                           3)   [3,5,7|8,2,9,4,15.6]                           4)   [3,5,7,8|2,9,4,15.6]
